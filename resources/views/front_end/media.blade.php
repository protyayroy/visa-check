                    With hospitable lodges and exceptionally good roads, Namibia
                    becomes perfect for individual exploration – by light aircraft,
                    guided expedition or self-drive on your next adventure.

                    From the soaring red dunes of Sossusvlei, the rich culture of
                    the coastal towns, and the wildlife of Etosha National Park:
                    mountains, sea and safari in one iconic trip. Etosha National
                    Park belongs in the elite wildlife-watching destinations – big
                    cats, elephants, black rhinos and plains game in abundance.

                    Damaraland is a wonderful place to see desert-adapted elephants
                    and lions, and also happens to host Africa’s largest population
                    of free-ranging rhinos – rhino tracking is a real highlight
                    here. Over in the Caprivi Strip, the wildlife is returning, with
                    Bwabwata and Nkasa Rupara becoming wonderfully rich parks to
                    explore.

                    Experience the chilling wonders of the Skeleton Coast, battered
                    by the cold waters of the Atlantic from Walvis Bay to Lüderitz.
                    Along the Skeleton Coast to the Angolan border, shipwrecks along
                    the shore only heighten the sensation that humankind is here
                    very much at the mercy of the elements.{" "}

                    ​Namibia’s human story is every bit as interesting as that
                    written in the rocks, soil and sand of the country. Among the
                    rolling hills of Damaraland, troves of rock art tell of the San
                    people whose lives are inextricably linked with this land. The
                    pastoral Himba, too, are rooted in Namibian soil, their fragile
                    culture clinging on in the face of 21st-century challenges.{" "}

                    ​Perennial rivers – confined to the country’s northern and
                    southern boundaries – bring added riches. Head north to the
                    Kunene River for an exclusive holiday hideaway, or relax on a
                    leisurely safari on the erstwhile Caprivi Strip. The birdlife –
                    including some real rarities – is prolific, the scenery lush,
                    and the presence of hippos remind you that Namibia may be
                    unusual but it is, very firmly, in Africa.
