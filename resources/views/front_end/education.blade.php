                    MCCâ€™s $304.5 million Namibia Compact (2009-2014) funded the $145
                    million Education Project which included the Improving the Quality
                    of General Education Activity (Education Activity) and the Improving
                    Access to and Management of Textbooks Activity (Textbook Activity),
                    which aimed to improve the quality of the Namibian workforce by
                    enhancing the equity and effectiveness of basic education. The
                    Education Activity rehabilitated nearly 50 schools and funded
                    training for school personnel. The Textbook Activity distributed
                    textbooks to all Namibian schools and supported textbook procurement
                    and management reforms.
